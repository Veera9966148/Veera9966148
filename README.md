 # 💫 About Me:
I am a B.Sc. Computer Science student with my 5th semester completed, currently pursuing a long-term internship while actively building practical skills in full stack development.<br>My core technical focus is on Python-based development and frontend web technologies. I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern styling frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap to build clean, responsive interfaces. On the backend and data side, I have hands-on experience with SQL and MongoDB, along with version control using GitHub.<br>I have completed a short-term AI & ML internship through SmartInternz, where I worked on a Liver Cirrhosis Prediction project, gaining exposure to applying machine learning concepts to real-world healthcare data. Alongside this, I built and deployed my personal portfolio website, which is hosted and maintained through my GitHub account.<br>Although my long-term goal is to grow as a Full Stack Developer, I also have foundational exposure to AI, Machine Learning, and Generative AI, supported by certifications from Google and IBM. I actively track emerging and trending AI skills to stay relevant with industry demands beyond 2026.<br>My learning approach is self-driven and practical. I focus on learning smart—by understanding concepts deeply and applying them through projects rather than relying on theory alone. I consistently invest 3–4 hours daily in improving my technical skills and industry knowledge.<br>I maintain an active GitHub profile, a portfolio website, and a YouTube channel (VeereshTalks) where I aim to grow my technical presence over time.<br>I am currently seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my skills, learn from real-world systems, and grow into a strong full stack professional with a solid understanding of modern development and AI-assisted workflows.
